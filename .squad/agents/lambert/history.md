## Learnings

<!-- Append learnings below -->

### 2026-04-14 — radialtree layout tests

Wrote `internal/radialtree/layout_test.go` (white-box, `package radialtree`) with 12 test cases covering:
- Root always placed at centre (0,0)
- Children positioned in a ring at positive radius
- Single file child has positive DiscRadius
- Four equal-weight files produce four distinct angles (no duplicates)
- Nested depth: file radius > subdir radius > root radius (0)
- Larger metric value produces larger DiscRadius
- LabelAll: both root and file ShowLabel == true
- LabelFoldersOnly: root ShowLabel == true, file ShowLabel == false
- LabelNone: both ShowLabel == false
- Empty directory returns without panic
- Root.Label reflects directory Name
- Larger canvasSize produces larger child radii

Followed the exact style from `internal/treemap/layout_test.go`: `t.Parallel()`, `NewGomegaWithT(t)`, nilaway-safe nil guards, no testify.

### 2026-04-14 — PR review fixes: layout tests + render tests

**Changes to `internal/radialtree/layout_test.go`:**
- Added `"sort"` import
- Replaced `TestLayoutAnglesFullCircle` body: now sorts the 4 angles and verifies consecutive gaps are ~π/2 (within 5% tolerance) instead of just checking uniqueness
- Added `TestLayoutZeroMetricUsesMinDisc`: verifies file with no metric value gets `minFileDisc` radius (the floor)
- Added `TestLayoutUniformMetricUsesMidpoint`: verifies files with equal metric values all receive the `(fileMin+fileMax)/2` midpoint radius, and it's > minFileDisc
- Added `TestComputeLeafCountEmptyDir`: verifies `computeLeafCount` returns 0 for empty dir (actual behaviour, not the old misleading doc comment)
- Added `TestComputeLeafCountWithFiles`: verifies `computeLeafCount` returns 2 for a dir with 2 files

**New file `internal/render/radialtree_test.go`:**
- 4 tests: FlatDir, NestedDir, LabelModes (3 subtests), EmptyDir
- All use `&node` as per the pointer-receiver API Parker introduced
- Tests use `makeFile(name, ext, size)` helper from `renderer_test.go` (same package)
- Parker's `radialtree.go` had a pre-existing unused `sort` import (WIP) that blocks compilation of the render package; the render tests will compile once Parker resolves that

**Key learnings:**
- `computeLeafCount` returns actual 0 for empty dir; zero-guard happens at call site in `layoutDir`
- `buildDiscParams` sets `useEqual=true` when all non-zero metric values are equal (single-value or uniform case)
- Render test compilation depends on Parker completing their `sort`-usage addition to `radialtree.go`

### 2026-04-18 — Foliage palette tests

Added `TestFoliagePalette` to `internal/palette/palette_test.go` covering:
- 11 colour steps, ordered, correct name
- First step near-black (R, G, B all ≤ 30)
- Last step green-dominant (G > R and G > B)
- Foliage already included in `TestPaletteName_IsValid` and `TestWCAGContrastRatio` by Dallas

Pattern: palette tests follow a consistent shape — step count, ordered flag, name check, then endpoint colour assertions. WCAG contrast test covers all ordered palettes via a shared loop.

### 2026-04-19 — bubbletree layout tests

Wrote `internal/bubbletree/layout_test.go` (white-box, `package bubbletree`) with 16 test cases covering:
- Root enclosure (radius > 0, IsDirectory true, all children geometrically contained)
- No overlap (sibling circles don't overlap within 1px tolerance)
- Radius scaling (larger metric → larger radius)
- Nesting depth (nested dirs produce nested circles, containment holds at every level)
- Label modes (LabelAll, LabelFoldersOnly, LabelNone each set ShowLabel correctly)
- Empty directory (non-panic, positive radius, no children)
- Single file (centred in parent, contained)
- Large flat directory (20 files pack without overlap)
- Zero metric (missing value gets positive radius floor)
- Uniform metric (equal values → equal radii)
- Canvas bounds (root circle fits within width × height)
- Root label (matches directory name)
- Root IsDirectory (root true, file child false)
- Deep nesting (3-level tree, containment at every level)
- Mixed files and dirs (file + subdir siblings, no overlap, containment)

Helper functions: `assertContainment` (recursive parent-child geometric check), `assertNoOverlap` (recursive sibling pair distance check), `allChildren` (depth-first collector).

Tests follow exact style from radialtree/treemap: `t.Parallel()`, `NewGomegaWithT(t)`, nilaway-safe nil guards, dot-imported gomega matchers. Tests won't compile until Dallas delivers the layout engine — that's expected.
